# Online-Bookstore

This is a learning project. --
I am following the online tutorials and creating/adapting the codes into my use case. --
The goal is to simulate an online bookstore from scratch. --
I built up backend server using Spring Boot, applied Bootstrap to develop front-end view, Thymeleaf as template engine, HTML/CSS to develop static page, used JavaScript and jQuery to manipulate DOM object and gain access to HTML/XML document, finally used MySQL as the backend database server and manage large and complex datasets.

### On-going plan
Next step, I am planning to deploy this app to the webserver of AWS or Heroku.
